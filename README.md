## About me

&nbsp;

Hey there! I am Alex, a computer science student at Addis Ababa University and a fellow Flutter developer with over 7 months of experience. I have previously worked on personal projects, including a note-taking app and a property management app for my local church.

This has been an excellent month spent on this project, which provided me with a valuable learning experience. I got to explore features that were previously unknown to me. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this project and hope to continue working with InternSavy in the future.


&nbsp;

## Features

&nbsp;

- This is a 5-in-1 app. It has 5 different apps that are all accessible from the home screen.
- In the home screen, you will find cards for the 5 apps together with brief descriptions on actual implementation that I have opted to use on the back of it.
- I have added localizations for languages: English, Indian (Hindi), Russian, and Amharic.
