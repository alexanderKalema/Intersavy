## About me

&nbsp;

Hey there! I am Alex, a computer science major at Addis Ababa University and a fellow Flutter
developer with over 7 months of experience. I have previously worked on personal projects, including
a note-taking app and a property management app for my local church.

This has been an excellent month spent on this project, which provided me with a valuable learning
experience. I got to explore features that were previously unknown to me. I am grateful for the
opportunity to work on this project and hope to continue working with InternSavy in the future.

&nbsp;

## Features

&nbsp;

- This is a 5-in-1 app. It has 5 different apps that are all accessible from the home screen.
- I have tried my best to make minimal usage of external packages.
- I have created separate branches in this repo during implementation phase for what I considered to
  be major tasks (milestones).
- In the home screen, you will find cards for the 5 apps together with brief descriptions on actual
  implementation that I have opted to use by flipping the card to its back.
- I have added localizations for languages: English, Indian (Hindi), Russian, and Amharic except for
  the descriptions behind the cards.
- It might take a little while when loading the screenshots in this readme file.
- I still consider myself a junior developer, with a big room for improvement! If you encounter any
  bugs, report them to me through @alexanderkalema@gmail.com.
- Lastly, make sure to run command "flutter pub get" to get the dependencies, Enjoy !!
